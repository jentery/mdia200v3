# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Songhees and Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the Lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgS8kOsjYY), Songhees Elder Elmer George welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ people in lək̓ʷəŋən and English. The acknowledgement in this video was prepared in consultation with local Indigenous communities.

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I continue to learn about those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/home) and this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too.

# Description
