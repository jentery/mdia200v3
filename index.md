# Territory Acknowledgement 

As a researcher and instructor at the University of Victoria, I acknowledge and respect the Lək̓ʷəŋən (Songhees and Esquimalt) Peoples on whose territory the university stands, and the Lək̓ʷəŋən and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ Peoples whose historical relationships with the land continue to this day. I'm a settler scholar at UVic, and I arrived here as an uninvited guest in July 2011. 

In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAgS8kOsjYY), Songhees Elder Elmer George welcomes visitors to the traditional lands of the Songhees, Esquimalt, and <u>W</u>SÁNEĆ people in lək̓ʷəŋən and English. The acknowledgement in this video was prepared in consultation with local Indigenous communities.

The fact that we're gathering at UVic to study media is a product of colonization and injustice upon local lands, waters, and people. I continue to learn about those injustices, and I will make no assumptions about your knowledge or experiences of them. As part of this course, I invite ongoing dialogue about territory acknowledgements and how UVic students, faculty, and staff are building good relations and fostering reciprocity. 

I've learned a lot about territory acknowledgements from the Native Students Union's [webpage](https://www.uvicnsu.ca/home) and this August 2019 [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/76wRKpfhNDS08ehRvtETmR) of *U in the Ring*: "With Knowledge Comes Responsibility: Territory Acknowledgements," featuring Jeff Ganohalidoh Corntassel, Maggie Easton, Steven Farina, Robbie Lewis, Qwul'sih'yah'maht Robina Thomas, and Kolin Sutherland-Wilson. I welcome your recommendations, too.

# Description

This course "surveys the cultural and material roles media play around the world in the 21st century. Emphasis on building a common vocabulary for studying media as well as understanding how audio, images, video, and text mediate people’s relation to culture." For more information, see ["MDIA200 - Media in the 21st Century"](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/courses/HyVj9LZJi?bc=true&bcCurrent=MDIA200%20-%20Media%20in%20the%2021st%20Century&bcGroup=Media%20Studies%20(MDIA)&bcItemType=courses) in UVic's academic calendar. 

The course counts toward UVic's new [Media Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/media-studies/program/index.php) certificate, which requires 10.5 units of coursework. 

# Goals

I designed this course for you to: 

1. Build a vocabulary for understanding media. This means you'll develop a language for attending to the particulars of audio, images, text, video, and interfaces. 
2. Learn a variety of techniques for engaging media today. This means we'll experiment with different approaches to media in the 21st century. 
3. Account for context and culture in the analysis of media across the globe. This means we'll consider how, where, when, by whom, for whom, and under what assumptions media are made, interpreted, and circulated. 
4. Respond directly to classroom activities and lectures about media. This means you'll complete four worksheets to demonstrate what you're learning.  
5. Reflect on your learning and communicate its applications to the study and production of media today. This reflection will take the form of a portfolio, which will be your final project in this course. 

I will assume you've no experience in Media Studies, and I will focus on critical approaches to media as they apply to content production. I will not teach film. For that, I recommend [Film Studies](https://www.uvic.ca/finearts/film). I also won't teach technical or professional communication. For that, I recommend [Professional Communication](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/professionalcommunication/).

# About Us 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I skip a syllable and say it in two: "JEN-tree." You can call me Jentery, Doctor Sayers, or Professor Sayers. 

I spend 14.68% of the day looking for my glasses, and I enjoy writing about games and media. I grew up in Richmond, Virginia and went to Virginia Commonwealth University for my BA and BS degrees. Then I moved to Seattle, where I received an MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington. I now teach courses for UVic Media Studies and English, and I direct the Media Studies program. I like to play TTRPGs, drums, guitar, and soccer in my spare time. I also do my best to maintain a [portfolio](https://jntry.work/) of my work. 

You can email me at [jentery@uvic.ca](mailto:jentery@uvic.ca) or find me in Clearihue D331.

# Materials 

You do *not* need to purchase a textbook or any primary sources for this course, but you will need access to a computer, the internet (including [Brightspace](https://bright.uvic.ca/)), a camera, and a microphone. 

*Handouts*: I produce my own handouts for this course and will circulate them in Brightspace each week. They include concise overviews of key themes and terms to help you prepare for upcoming class sessions. You can think of them as an alternative to a MDIA 200 textbook. 

*Slide Decks*: I will create an HTML slide deck for each class session and link to it in Brightspace immediately before class begins. This way, you can access my slides during and after class. 

*Primary Sources*: My slide decks will frequently contain primary sources or links to them. We'll discuss these primary sources in class to apply what you're learning from the weekly handouts. Examples of primary sources we'll study this term include the browser game, [*Hair Nah*](https://www.momopixel.com/hair-nah) (2017), by Momo Pixel; the comic, ["Translated, From the Japanese"](https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/killing-and-dying/) (2015), by Adrian Tomine; the stop-motion animation, [*Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)*](https://www.spottedfawnproductions.com/biidaaban/) (2018), by Amanda Strong, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, and Bracken Hanuse Corlett; and the photo story, ["Fighting for Food Sovereignty Amid Worsening Wildfires"](https://thenarwhal.ca/indigenous-food-sovereignty-wildfires-bc/) (2023), by Steph Kwetásel'wet Wood. 

*Content Warnings*: I'll include content warnings for materials, including primary sources, before I share or screen them in class. 

*Recordings*: I do not plan to record our class sessions; however, you are welcome to record audio of class for private study and note-taking.
 
*Brightspace*: I'll use the course Brightspace to: 

* Circulate a class announcement each *Monday* to help you plan for what's next,  
* Share weekly handouts, my slides, and any primary sources we study in class,  
* Point you to resources available online, 
* Accept all your assignments (please don't submit anything to me by email), and
* Comment on those assignments and mark them.

# Assignments

There are no exams, quizzes, presentations, group projects, or participation marks in this course.

I am asking you to complete five assignments this term. 

1. **[Worksheet 1](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v3/worksheet1.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Thursday, September 26th at 10am). 
2. **[Worksheet 2](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v3/worksheet2.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Monday, October 21st at 10am). 
3. **[Worksheet 3](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v3/worksheet3.html)**: 20% of your final grade (due by Thursday, November 14th at 10am).
4. **[Worksheet 4](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v3/worksheet4.html)**: 15% of your final grade (due by Monday, December 2nd at 10am). 
5. **[Portfolio](https://jentery.github.io/mdia200v3/portfolio.html)**: 25% of your final grade (due by Friday, December 13th at 10am). 

*Worksheets*: The worksheets will ask you to apply what you're learning in class through a combination of media (audio, images, text, and video). A worksheet will never contain more than five prompts, and I will encourage you to use class time to draft your brief responses to them. I will circulate each worksheet well before it's due, and I'll review each prompt in class to ensure it's clear. 

*Portfolio*: You'll conclude MDIA 200 by producing a portfolio that documents what you learned in this course, reflects on that learning, and communicates its significance to someone in particular (e.g., a professor, student, friend, or family member).  

*Brightspace*: Please use Brightspace to submit all your work this term. You do not need to purchase any software to use Brightspace, but you will need your UVic NetLink ID, access to the internet, and a computer. I cannot accept assignments by email. Thank you for understanding.  

*Feedback*: I will provide brief and focused feedback on worksheets according to their grading rubrics. Please email me or schedule an appointment (F2F or Zoom) to discuss my feedback. I respond to emails Monday through Friday, 9am - 5pm, excluding holidays. Thanks in advance for your patience. 

*Workshop*: Worksheet 4 will ask you to register for a workshop in UVic Libraries, attend it, and document what you did and learned. I will circulate a signup sheet for the workshops in September.

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this course is that *I'll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut material. I planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.

I suggest dedicating *3 to 5 hours* to MDIA 200 each week in addition to our weekly meetings on Monday and Thursday. Of course, 3 to 5 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your familiarity with the work and materials involved.

I will give you some time during class to draft responses to the worksheets; however, you will need more time (between classes) to develop and refine your work, hence the recommended 3 to 5 hours per week. 

# Schedule

Here's the schedule for the term. It's subject to change. In fact, I'm 94.37% certain it will change. I will use a Brightspace announcement to notify you at least two weeks in advance of those changes, and I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload (e.g., add an assignment or reading). 

*All materials for this course are available in Brightspace. Please study them before the date they're assigned.* This way, we can make the most of our time together in class. 

All meetings are scheduled to occur in person (face-to-face). If you miss a class session, or you simply want a review, then I recommend checking Brightspace to view the slide deck for that session and touching base with a peer to see if they're willing to share their notes.
